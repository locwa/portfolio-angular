                Hi, my name is Louis Policarpio. I'm a Computer Science student at University of Baguio.
                I've always been a life-long learner dedicated to finding the hows and the whys
                of everything, as everything in the world is a source of knowledge that can be
                applied in many things. I'm also passionate in reading, hiking, and playing basketball
                whenever I'm not in front of the computer. New technologies always peak my curiosity
                and what keeps me excited about what the future holds.
